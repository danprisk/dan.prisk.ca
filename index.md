I am a graduate student in sociology at the University of British Columbia.

There I study environmental sociology, social movements, and social theory. 

My research questions the individual and structural factors that contribute to environmental care, how those differing contexts interact with social movements, and the impact they have on social and environmental justice in the futures that we build. 

Similar questions motivate my interest in a resurgent far right: asking if and how this current resurgence differs from prior movements, and what factors of our social structures have given space for their rise.
