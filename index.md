### About

I'm a social scientist with a professional background in software
development. I received my M.A. in
[Sociology](https://sociology.ubc.ca/) from [The University of British
Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), where I studied sociology of
environment, marginalization, and health. 

Prior to returning to academia I led product and project management
for Agile software development teams in startup environments.

### Research

My research explores if and how climate change is impacting health in
Canada, and if that effect is differentiated by race, gender, and
class. I am primarily interested in critical quantitative and
computational methods.
